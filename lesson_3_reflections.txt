local?

stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	Because u would wnat to continue working on without being interuppted by chang made
	by someone else on repo to effect your work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	Fork is making copy of repo on github, clones is making a copy of repo on github to local
	directory, branches is on existing repos.Fork is used when u want to work on github
	directly, clones to work locally on ur computer, branches to work on ur own copy of a repo.
