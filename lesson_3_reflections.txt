When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
	
	When people want to work on the repo from different locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	Because u would wnat to continue working on without being interuppted by chang made
	by someone else on repo to effect your work.
